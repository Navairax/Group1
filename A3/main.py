#EXPLANATION OF OUTPUT
#Model Output: The model was successfully opened, as indicated by "model opened succesfully"
#Floor-to-Floor heights:The code prints the height differences between consecutive levels in the model:
#-The output shows that the height between different levels is approximatelt 3800 ifcs units. (level 0-1 is 7600)

#POTENTIAL FLOOR AND CEILING COUNTS:
# 23 potential floor elemetns: these could be slabs or elements matching the criteria for floors based on their predefinedtype or name
# 17 potential ceilings elements: these could be slabs or covering that match the criteria for ceilings based on their predefinedtype or name. 

#INTERPRETATION
# The codes analysis helps identify storey heights
# The potential floor and ceiling counts indicate elements that are suspected to be mislabelled or require verification. This is important for ensuring the BIM models data integrity, as mislabelled elements can lead ro errors in analysis and project planning,
