## description of A2-A4

### A2: The project began with assignment 2, where we explores our focus area ceilings in the selected IFC model. This phase was crucial for understanding the scope of the data and identifying potential challenges in handling and processing. We made a code to detect a claim of the floor-to-floot height of the building in the IFC model. By the end of A2 we had a understanding of the approach.

### A3: In assignment 3, we developed a tool utilizing blender BIM software and the Visual studio code add-on to validate building measurements directly from the IFC model. This tool was designed to help the design team verify dimension. Specifically floor-to-floor and floor-to-ceiling heights - throughout the design phase to ensure compliance with mimimum requirements. Although here we stumbled upon a challenge of mislabelling in the IFC models which gave us some trouble with our tool, but this is what we adress in A4.

### A4: In Assignment 4 we focused on adressing mislabeling issues in the IFC models, specifically targeting incorrectly labeled building elements such as ceiling. the goal was to improve the accuracy of BIM data classification, which is essential for a better project management and data analysis. We made a video tutorial with a step-by-step guide for BIM users to identify and correct mislabelled elements in IFC models. This work builds upon the foundations laid in A3 by adressing key limitations in ceiling classification.
