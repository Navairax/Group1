# Assignment 5 | Group 1 

## Intro to Project Reflection
### Our group started off with little to no knowledge on BIM,IFC, and python, however with time and interest we really were able to grasp the concepts and to think about how can we utilize this for our projects in the course but also for our future. We internally reflected on how important this concept will be in 10 years time and with our foundation from this course, it will be a good starting point for our future careers. Overall this reflection, covers extensively how this entire course was one big learning curve and how beneficial it can be to learn from each others peer reviews and by doing the assignments. 

## Our Learning Experience  
### Our group's learning level at the beginning of the course was quite beginner. All three of us had basic programming skills and vague knowledge on Open BIM. This meant that there was a steep learning curve at the beginning to be able to grasp all the concepts and how to benefit from BIM. We would still need to learn about all of the blender BIM wide set of tools and how to effectively use python to get the IFC information needed. These tools combined can really be beneficial to standardized and efficientizing the building industry so we can see that OpenBIM is here to stay. We would use OpenBIM to develop base line models of projects that are easily sharable and can help teams have that common understanding and common platform to visually communicate buildings.  

## The Process of Developing a Tutorial 
### To develop the tutorial (A4) we initially wanted to teach others about the process of performing simple checks, such as the floor-to-floor height. When developing that, we came across the problem of mislabelled Ifc elements in the model. This mislabelling seemed to be a common issue among the three Ifc building models and the architecture groups. Therefore, we ultimately decided the tutorial that would make most sense would be one that addresses the root cause of everyones problems. The mislabelling of elements in a model. The tutorial that we developed was then basically aimed at solving our own mislabelled floor and ceilings and then teaching the others how to use our method and script to identify and correct their own mislabelled elements. The process of developing the script and tutorial was definitely iterative and involved many trials and errors.  

## The Process of Relating the Course to the Thesis
### The course's assignment structure certainly enabled that process to be smoother as every assignment built on the other. From A1 to A3, not only did we learn the basics, the ifc model, and scripting but those assignments also were the foundation of A4. The process of the course didn't enable us to find or define questions that might be needed for the thesis however it did enable us to build on knowledge slowly to be able to address unknown challenges in our thesis and future work. 

## Less Choices for the Use Case & Number of Tools 
### We think that it was the right amount of choice given in the choice of the use case. The number of tools in the course was certainly a lot, however I think they did flow symbiotically and made sense given the course and assignments. It is overwhelming at first to be given that many tools and so I think a check in during week 3/4 to quickly go over the tools again and any issues that may arise when scripting would have been helpful.  

## Summary of the Feedback on our Tutorial 
### The tool did address the use case we identified as it ultimately looks at the root of the problem in these IFC models and despite it being time consuming to set up. The long term value is that it would save time and effort. Below is a summarized list of the comments we got from the other groups. Most of the feedback talks about how useful our tool is and the rest talks about the time this tool takes to be efficient.  	 
#### The feedback directly from the other groups: 
> * This helps clean up the model and ensures that time spent on it by designers and planners is more efficient. 
> * Simplifies the model by cleaning it up AND finds "missing" elements which seems pretty nice.  
> * This tool seems very helpful, particularly in simplifying models early in the project process. 
> * Over time, as the tool is used more often, its library of known errors will grow, making it increasingly effective. 
> * Seems useful but there is a lot of manual work initially - might be less the more the tool is used 
> * Initially, some time will be needed to identify and define potential errors within the script. However, this is a one-time effort that will diminish with continued use. 
> * This tool has the potential to be highly beneficial in the real-world industry. While it may require some effort at the start, its long-term efficiency gains make it a valuable contribution. The group did a great job on this project.

### Through working with A1-A5, I have gained a good understanding of Openbim and its use in the construction. A1 was a good introduction to working with BIM models in Python and gave me a solid foundation for the later tasks. In A2, we were asked to define a use case for BIM, which helped me understand how the technology is used across construction projects.

### A3 and A4 were the most challenging tasks, especially due to errors in the BIM model, which we had to adjust several times. This has given me experience in problem solving and the importance of a stable basis in Openbim. Although frustrating, it has been instructive and given me a better understanding of how Openbim works in practice.

### I feel that the tasks are well connected and have given me an understanding of Openbim. I now see Openbim as an important tool in the construction industry.

### My future for advanced use of OpenBIM is limited as I am already currently writing my thesis and I have not chosen anything related to BIM. I am however likely to use OpenBim in my professional life in the future as it where the industry is heading. It is also a super important tool for the building industry to capitalise off of.  

### My journey through A1- A5 was certainly challenging. A1 was fairly easy and it helped lay the foundation for how to use a BIM model with python. It taught me how to read Ifc elements and write python scripts for the model. A2 was a stepping stone/foundation to make A3 and A4. It was super helpful in hindsight as it built all the necessary elements needed to explore the rest of the assignments. Assignment 3 was spent working on our script and analysing the BIM model on BlenderBIM. A3 and A4 was the big learning curve as that was where a lot of what we planned for did not work due to inconsistencies in the model. This made it so we had to pivot and iterate our plan quite a few times. Overall, I think the assignments connected well to each other and when looking back all the tasks made sense.
